## Features

- Autonomous vehicle control: The system utilizes a trained Neural Network to analyze the environment and make steering decisions for the vehicle, allowing it to navigate the track and avoid obstacles.
- Realistic simulation: The project provides a visual interface that simulates the track and the cars present on it, allowing real-time visualization of the behavior of the autonomous vehicle.
- Customizable training: It is possible to train the Neural Network using machine learning techniques. This enables parameter adjustment and optimization of the vehicle's performance.

## Dependencies

- Python: The project requires Python version 3.x to be installed in order to run a local HTTP server.
- Bash Command: Use the command `python3 -m http.server` in the project's root directory to start the server.

Make sure you have Python properly installed on your machine before running the project.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the command `python3 -m http.server`. This will start a local HTTP server.
4. Open a web browser and access `http://localhost:8000` to view the project's interface.
5. Interact with the simulation and observe the behavior of the autonomous vehicle controlled by the Neural Network.

## Customization and Enhancement

This project serves as a foundation for developing more complex autonomous vehicle systems. You can adjust the parameters of the Neural Network, gather more training data, and implement advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the system's performance.

Feel free to explore and modify the source code to meet your specific needs.
